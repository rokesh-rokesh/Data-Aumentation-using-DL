# Data-Aumentation-using-DL

This repository demonstrates the implementation of data augmentation techniques in a deep learning model to enhance performance and address overfitting issues. The augmented model achieved an accuracy of 95 percent on the validation set, surpassing the non-augmented model, which attained 94 percent accuracy. Additionally, the augmented model exhibits improved generalization as it effectively fits and trains on the dataset, contrasting with the overfitting observed in the non-augmented model.
